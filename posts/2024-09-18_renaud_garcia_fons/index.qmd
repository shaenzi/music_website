A friend recently gae me the tipp that Renaud Garcia Fons might be worth listening to - and after going down a rabbit hole of albums and videos, I can confirm: this man is definitely worth listening to!

What I am particularly interested in, of course, are his solo pieces where he uses a looper, like this:

or like this:

You can listen to the full solo album on bandcamp:

Or watch the Tiny Desk concert:

He also has several albums where he plays together with other people, which are totally worth listening to as well.

An incredible bass player!
