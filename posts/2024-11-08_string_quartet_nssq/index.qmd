I love string quartets - some of my fondest memories of music making with others are string quartets (or, on one memorable occasion, Mendelssohn's octet!). However, I gravitated towards non-classical music recently, and imagine my joy in realising that there are string quartets to be found in that space too!
One of them is the [North Sea String Quartet](https://www.northseaquartet.com/), whose music I'd like to highlight here (the image for this post is the cover of their latest album).

Their compilation video gives you an idea of what they sound like:

They also collaborate with singers, such as the Brazilian singer Lilian Vieira:

Their album "Songs for Flying" with Roland Satterwhite is one I've been listening to repeatedly:
