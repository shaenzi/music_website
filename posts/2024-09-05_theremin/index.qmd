I have become a regular listener of the BBC's [Add to playlist podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00106lb) (which definitely deserves its own blog post, but that's something for another day). It's a programme where I am exposed to a lot of music I haven't heard before, and the one experience I'd like to share with you today is hearing a theremin.

If you don't know what that is - don't fret, I didn't know either. The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin) as usual has you covered: the theremin is an electronic instrument that looks like two antennae, which are actually half of a capacitor and act as position sensors for your hands. One hand controls the pitch and the other controls the amplitude of the sound. Caronlina Eyck has a nice video showing how she plays a scale:

It sounds quite eerily like a human voice, don't you think? I also listened to [the episode on the theremin](https://www.br.de/mediathek/podcast/klassik-fuer-klugscheisser/it-s-magic-alles-uebers-theremin/2026052) by the Klassik für Klugscheisser Podcast (in German), which has a few more tidbits about the sounds and history of this instrument.

Anyway, the song I heard in the original podcast was an arrangement of Claire de Lune by Carolina Eyck for theremin and voice:

If you got hooked, [here](https://carolinaeyck.bandcamp.com/album/thetis-2086)'s the whole album and [here](https://www.carolinaeyck.com/) is her website.
