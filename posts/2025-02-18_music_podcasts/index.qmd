Music podcasts for me are an opportunity to be exposed to unfamiliar music, find inspiration and learn some tidbits about artists, composers and their works. 

The first music podcast I regularly listened to (and still do!) is "Add to Playlist", currently with Jeffrey Boakye and Anna Phoebe, from BBC Radio 4. They invite 2 guests into the studio and create a playlist, one at a time. The next piece somehow has to be linked to the previous one in any possible way (musically, thematically, ... you name it). What a ride through the centuries!

Also from the BBC is "This classical life" with Jess Gillam. Herself an acclaimed saxophone player, she interviews other musicians about their (musical) life. They both bring along pieces and tell the listeners, what they like about them. Always interesting!

For the German speakers among you: I also like "Klassik für Klugscheisser", where I learn lots about the background and context of some music, "Klassik Crush", which allows a glimpse into the personal life of some artists, and finally "Interpretationssache", which gathers different interpretations of one piece, bei it classical or pop.

Happy listening!
