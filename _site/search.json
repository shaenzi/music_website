However, I gravitated towards non-classical music recently, and imagine my joy in realising that there are string quartets to be found in that space too! One of them is the North Sea String Quartet, whose music I’d like to highlight here (the image for this post is the cover of their latest album).\nTheir compilation video gives you an idea of what they sound like:\n\n\nThey also collaborate with singers, such as the Brazilian singer Lilian Vieira:\n\n\nTheir album “Songs for Flying” with Roland Satterwhite is one I’ve been listening to repeatedly:\n\n&lt;a href=\"https://northseastringquartet.bandcamp.com/album/songs-for-flying-ep-2019\"&gt;Songs For Flying (EP, 2019) by Roland Satterwhite &amp; North Sea String Quartet&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nArtists mentioned\nNorth Sea String Quartet: Website, Bandcamp, Youtube"

    "text": "Music podcasts for me are an opportunity to be exposed to unfamiliar music, find inspiration and learn some tidbits about artists, composers and their works.\nThe first music podcast I regularly listened to (and still do!) is “Add to Playlist”, currently with Jeffrey Boakye and Anna Phoebe, from BBC Radio 4. They invite 2 guests into the studio and create a playlist, one at a time. The next piece somehow has to be linked to the previous one in any possible way (musically, thematically, … you name it). What a ride through the centuries!\nAlso from the BBC is “This classical life” with Jess Gillam. Herself an acclaimed saxophone player, she interviews other musicians about their (musical) life. They both bring along pieces and tell the listeners, what they like about them. Always interesting!\nFor the German speakers among you: I also like “Klassik für Klugscheisser”, where I learn lots about the background and context of some music, “Klassik Crush”, which allows a glimpse into the personal life of some artists, and finally “Interpretationssache”, which gathers different interpretations of one piece, bei it classical or pop.\nHappy listening!\n\nPodcasts mentioned\n\nAdd to Playlist, BBC Radio 4\nThis classical life, BBC Radio 3\nKlassik für Klugscheisser, BR\nKlassik Crush, WDR\nInterpretationssache, ARD"

    "text": "I have become a regular listener of the BBC’s Add to playlist podcast (which definitely deserves its own blog post, but that’s something for another day). It’s a programme where I am exposed to a lot of music I haven’t heard before, and the one experience I’d like to share with you today is hearing a theremin.\nIf you don’t know what that is - don’t fret, I didn’t know either. The Wikipedia article as usual has you covered: the theremin is an electronic instrument that looks like two antennae, which are actually half of a capacitor and act as position sensors for your hands. One hand controls the pitch and the other controls the amplitude of the sound. Caronlina Eyck has a nice video showing how she plays a scale:\n\n\nIt sounds quite eerily like a human voice, don’t you think? I also listened to the episode on the theremin by the Klassik für Klugscheisser Podcast (in German), which has a few more tidbits about the sounds and history of this instrument.\nAnyway, the song I heard in the original podcast was an arrangement of Claire de Lune by Carolina Eyck for theremin and voice:\n\n&lt;a href=\"https://carolinaeyck.bandcamp.com/album/thetis-2086\"&gt;Thetis 2086 by Carolina Eyck&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you got hooked, here’s the whole album and here is her website.\nThe image for this post comes from Wikipedia and can be re-used with a CC BY-SA 3.0 license."

    "text": "Playing in orchestras and ensembles has always been fun - but coming back to music a bit more after a more sporty phase, I wasn’t quite attracted by classical ensembles. Then, with the help of some friends, I discovered looping, where you play and record yourself, so you can build up a whole ensemble on your own. I was fascinated, and this piece by Zoë Keating finally convinced me that I needed to get a looper:\n\n&lt;a href=\"https://music.zoekeating.com/album/one-cello-x-16-ep\"&gt;One Cello x 16 (EP) by Zoe Keating&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you are impatient, fast-forward to 2:10, I think it gets really fun from 2:20 or so. The cello is also very cool for looping because it is low enough to have a base, but flexible enough to play higher melodies and all sorts of different sounds. Another exmple where we can see Zoë play:\n\n\nWhile Zoë uses a laptop and a midi controller, and programs her sequences herself, I decided I didn’t want to stare at a screen yet again, so I bought myself a pedal looper, and thereby started my looping adventure.\n\nArtists mentioned\nZoë Keating: website, her albums on bandcamp (the image for this post is her bandcamp profile picture)"
