    "section": "",
    "text": "Playing in orchestras and ensembles has always been fun - but coming back to music a bit more after a more sporty phase, I wasn’t quite attracted by classical ensembles. Then, with the help of some friends, I discovered looping, where you play and record yourself, so you can build up a whole ensemble on your own. I was fascinated, and this piece by Zoe Keating finally convinced me that I needed to get a looper:\n\n&lt;a href=\"https://music.zoekeating.com/album/one-cello-x-16-ep\"&gt;One Cello x 16 (EP) by Zoe Keating&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you are impatient, fast-forward to 2:10, I think it gets really fun from 2:20 or so. The cello is also very cool for looping because it is low enough to have a base, but flexible enough to play higher melodies and all sorts of different sounds. Another exmple where we can see Zoe play:\n\n\nWhile Zoe uses a laptop and a midi controller, and programs her sequences herself, I decided I didn’t want to stare at a screen yet again, so I bought myself a pedal looper, and thereby started my looping adventure."
