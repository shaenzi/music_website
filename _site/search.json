I won’t forget coding and all that, not least because this blog is written in quarto, and rendered and published using GitHub actions (if you don’t know what those are, never mind. If you do, you might be interested in my original blog too).\nI will tell you here about music I listen to, music and musicians that inspire me, and maybe one day also music that I make. I might also geek out on music hardware, especially about looping. Are you ready?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have become a regular listener of the BBC’s Add to playlist podcast (which definitely deserves its own blog post, but that’s something for another day). It’s a programme where I am exposed to a lot of music I haven’t heard before, and the one experience I’d like to share with you today is hearing a theremin.\nIf you don’t know what that is - don’t fret, I didn’t know either. The Wikipedia article as usual has you covered: the theremin is an electronic instrument that looks like two antennae, which are actually half of a capacitor and act as position sensors for your hands. One hand controls the pitch and the other controls the amplitude of the sound. Caronlina Eyck has a nice video showing how she plays a scale:\n\n\nIt sounds quite eerily like a human voice, don’t you think? I also listened to the episode on the theremin by the Klassik für Klugscheisser Podcast (in German), which has a few more tidbits about the sounds and history of this instrument.\nAnyway, the song I heard in the original podcast was an arrangement of Claire de Lune by Carolina Eyck for theremin and voice:\n\n&lt;a href=\"https://carolinaeyck.bandcamp.com/album/thetis-2086\"&gt;Thetis 2086 by Carolina Eyck&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you got hooked, here’s the whole album and here is her website."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Playing in orchestras and ensembles has always been fun - but coming back to music a bit more after a more sporty phase, I wasn’t quite attracted by classical ensembles. Then, with the help of some friends, I discovered looping, where you play and record yourself, so you can build up a whole ensemble on your own. I was fascinated, and this piece by Zoë Keating finally convinced me that I needed to get a looper:\n\n&lt;a href=\"https://music.zoekeating.com/album/one-cello-x-16-ep\"&gt;One Cello x 16 (EP) by Zoe Keating&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you are impatient, fast-forward to 2:10, I think it gets really fun from 2:20 or so. The cello is also very cool for looping because it is low enough to have a base, but flexible enough to play higher melodies and all sorts of different sounds. Another exmple where we can see Zoë play:\n\n\nWhile Zoë uses a laptop and a midi controller, and programs her sequences herself, I decided I didn’t want to stare at a screen yet again, so I bought myself a pedal looper, and thereby started my looping adventure.\n\nArtists mentioned\nZoë Keating: website, her albums on bandcamp"
