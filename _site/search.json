    "text": "After my motivation to post over at my regular blog hasn’t been great recently, I thought I could start a blog on something that occupies more of my time now: music. I won’t forget coding and all that, not least because this blog is written in quarto, and rendered and published using GitHub actions (if you don’t know what those are, never mind. If you do, you might be interested in my original blog too).\nI will tell you here about music I listen to, music and musicians that inspire me, and maybe one day also music that I make. I might also geek out on music hardware, especially about looping. Are you ready?"

Luckily for us, we can watch online even if we do not make it to the studio. While I haven’t listened to nearly enough of them, I already have quite a few favouriters, which I’d like to share with you:"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Playing in orchestras and ensembles has always been fun - but coming back to music a bit more after a more sporty phase, I wasn’t quite attracted by classical ensembles. Then, with the help of some friends, I discovered looping, where you play and record yourself, so you can build up a whole ensemble on your own. I was fascinated, and this piece by Zoë Keating finally convinced me that I needed to get a looper:\n\n&lt;a href=\"https://music.zoekeating.com/album/one-cello-x-16-ep\"&gt;One Cello x 16 (EP) by Zoe Keating&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you are impatient, fast-forward to 2:10, I think it gets really fun from 2:20 or so. The cello is also very cool for looping because it is low enough to have a base, but flexible enough to play higher melodies and all sorts of different sounds. Another exmple where we can see Zoë play:\n\n\nWhile Zoë uses a laptop and a midi controller, and programs her sequences herself, I decided I didn’t want to stare at a screen yet again, so I bought myself a pedal looper, and thereby started my looping adventure.\n\nArtists mentioned\nZoë Keating: website, her albums on bandcamp"
